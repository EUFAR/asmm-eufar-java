=======================================
  This project - Airborne Science Mission Metadata (ASMM) - was motivated by the need to create a standard set of mission reports, aiding in classification and searches of data sets based on flight phenomena, mission parameters or other criteria. To meet this goal, an XML format has been developed to store the mission report data in a standard manner, and an easy-to-use graphical user interface has been developed to facilitate creation and display of the standard XML files. This project contains the source code and executables for the ASMM creator as well as documentation describing the ASMM XML schema.
  ASMM Creator was coded by Matt Freer (EUFAR)
